# Security Policy

Butterfly is a hobby project developed by volunteers. It is unreleased software still in early development, and so bugs and vulnerabilities can be safely disclosed publicly. If you find an issue, we would prefer if you report it as a GitHub issue and include as much information as possible:

- Name of the project or repository affected
- High level summary of the issue and its potential impact
- Versions affected, if known
- Technical details and proof of concept, if possible
- Known mitigations or workarounds
- Attribution information

Sadly, we do not have the funds to run a Bug Bounty Program ðŸ˜¢
