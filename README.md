# This project is discontinued ‚ò†Ô∏è

**Due to a change in personal circumstances with the founder of the project, we no longer have the time or motivation to work on Butterfly. If you are interested in a Flutter-based desktop, then take a look at [dahliaOS](https://dahliaos.io/)**

# Butterfly Garden

This is where we are growing Butterfly ü¶ã A graphical environment created with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and [Dart](https://dart.dev/) for Linux workstations and *maybe* Android devices.

At least, that is the rough plan üòÑ

## Why? ü§î

We want to have fun ü§° and make something new ‚ú®

We want to try new ideas, learn new skills, make new mistakes and hopefully create a new way to interface with Linux workstations in the process. This is a project by us, for all us, based on the things we like.

**And you are most welcome to join the fun and help make something beautiful** ü¶ã

## The Plan üó∫

*There is no plan.*

In fact, at the time of writing there is no code just ideas. But we do have an overabundance of optimism, enthusiasm and potential.

What we've discussed so far is this:

 - Have fun, learn new skills, try new things and make new friends.
 - Make a graphical shell using Flutter and Dart. *How hard can it be?* üòú
 - Collaborate with [DahliaOS](https://dahliaos.io/) where ever possible.
 - Adhere to [freedesktop.org specifications](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/).
 - Use the Yaru [theme](https://pub.dev/packages/yaru), [icons](https://pub.dev/packages/yaru_icons) and [widgets](https://pub.dev/packages/yaru_widgets) for visual consistency.
 - Build an operating system based on Ubuntu called Ubuntu Butterfly (*remix*)
 - Collaborate with Flutter developers to bring beautiful cotemporary applications to Butterfly and Ubuntu Butterfly.
 - See if we can get Butterfly running on Android devices too.
 - Try and become an official Ubuntu flavour by the 24.10 release.
